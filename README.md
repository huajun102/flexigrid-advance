# flexigrid-advance
There are several old projects in each coder's hand, but they feel unable to change their skins because of too many modifications. There are also some things that can't be abandoned if they want to use the new framework. Now this plug-in can perfectly make the list of projects bigger and bigger. It supports batch check, supports automatic generation of search box for each project, brings its own search and reset buttons, and can add custom buttons at the top, Column operation buttons can be customized, and the original HTML buttons can be arranged into pop-up and drop-down button combinations.
